In 2019 I began designing home and office decor prints as a creative outlet. They are available for instant download at my Etsy shop, <a href="https://www.etsy.com/shop/PrintsByLolo">Prints by Lolo</a>.

	<h1> Clippers Long Hill Salon: Site Redesign </h1>



	<h2> Before </h2>

	<img class="screenshots" src="images/clippersoldsitescreenshot.png"> </img>

	<p class="body_text"> The previous version of the site had only basic contact information, no photos or examples of the salon's work, and almost no interactivity for visitors viewing the page. The only item that was clickable was the small facebook icon underneath the address and contact info. </p>
</p>

	<h2> After </h2>

	<img class="screenshots" src="images/screenshotnewsite3.png"> </img>

	


	<p class="body_text"> The business owner already had a good deal of existing branding material and sought a site that remained consistent with her print ads as well as her salon atmosphere. 

	<br> 
	<br>
	Before meeting with the business owner I created some basic sketches and mockups showing a sample architecture for the site. She was pleased with the layout and functionality I suggested and asked me to change a few things.



	</p>

		<img class = "portfolio_thumbnails" src="images/ClippersLongHillMockupSketches.007.jpeg"> </img>


	

	<p class="body_text">
		Based on that feedback, I edited multiple iterations before officially relaunching the site to the public. The final product implemented HTML, CSS, and several jQuery plugins and allowed the end-user to access sample photos of the salon stylists' work as well as general information about the salon's services and staff.

		<h1> Consulting and Tutorial Work: <br> Site Migrating a site to Squarespace and Streamlining Content</h1>
	
	</p>
		
	<p class="body_text">
		One of my clients placed tremendous value in being able to easily make updates to her new site herself. After consulting with her to determine how to best represent her content in a user-friendly manner, I migrated her previous stand-alone site to Squarespace CMS and then performed several one-on-one tutorials covering different tasks for using Squarespace. 
		<br> 

		She was thrilled and empowered to have a new mobile-friendly, sleek site which she could easily update herself.

		<h1> Mio Caro Amaro </h1>
	

	
		<h2> Process </h2>
</p>

	<p class="body_text">

		Mio Caro Amaro grew out of a personal desire to combine my background in spirits/mixology and my skills in web design and development. As I tried to learn more about amaro, a category of bitter Italian beverages, I found a lack of information available online. 
	</p>

	<p class="body_text">


		I decided to fill that void and create a user-friendly, one-stop resource for others who were also interested in learning about different types of amaro and how to use them. Eventually I hope to branch into other lesser-known spirits and create an online encyclopedia for other food and drink enthusiasts.

		Mio Caro Amaro translates to "My dear Amaro" in English.  

	</p>	


	<h2> Mockups </h2>

	<p class="body_text">

		During sketching, wireframing, and mockup creation I tested several potential layouts for the site. Below is the final homepage design which will soon be a live prototype.  

	</p>

		<h1> Visual Design: Book Cover Design Project </h1>
	</p>

	<p class="body_text">
		For a course in graphic and print design I created 3 different book cover ideas focusing on varied typographic treatments. The book cover was based on a sci-fi short story by Steven Millhauser entitled "Invasion From Outer Space". Below are some of the initial basic colored pencil sketches, a digital prototype created in Illustrator, and photos of the printed final product.
