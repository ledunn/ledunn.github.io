	<h2> The Long Road:  Design Process and Philosophy From Beginning to Completion </h2>

	<p class="body_text"> The business owner already had a good deal of existing branding material and sought a site that remained consistent with her print ads as well as her salon atmosphere. 

	</p>

	<p class="body_text"> Before meeting with the business owner I created sketches and mockups showing a sample architecture for the site. She was pleased with the layout and functionality I suggested and asked me to change a few things.

	<!---    insert pictures/links here-->	

	</p>

	<p class="body_text">
		Based on that feedback, I edited multiple iterations before officially relaunching the site to the public. The final product implemented HTML, CSS, and several jQuery plugins and allowed the end-user to access sample photos of the salon stylists' work as well as general information about the salon's services and staff.
