This resulted in scattered light tree damage and power outages.   In addition, there were two indirectly-related vehicle accident deaths.  In one case, a woman was killed as her son lost control of the vehicle on a wet road during a rain shower, which led to a head-on collision in the town of Grafton (Ozaukee Co.) around 0825CST (poor visibility and inattentiveness may have been factors, based on the police report).  Elsewhere, a man died in Fitchburg (Dane Co.) around 1500CST when he lost control of his vehicle trying to swerve from a large tree limb on the road, and hit another tree.  Some notable maximum wind gusts include 43 knots (50 mph) at Sheboygan North High School (Sheboygan Co. - Milwaukee TV-6 school net site), 42 knots at Madison Memorial High School (Dane Co. - Madison TV-15 school net site), and 41 knots (47 mph) at the ASOS units at both Milwaukee Mitchell Field (Milwaukee Co.) and the Sheboygan County Airport northwest of Sheboygan Falls.  Last, but not least, temperatures fell to unseasonably cold levels in the 30s during the afternoon.  A mix of rain and snow or all light snow resulted toward the tail end of a convective precipitation shield during the later afternoon and overnight hours.  Snow accumulations up to 1 inch occurred on top of 1716-foot high Blue Mound in eastern Iowa County, as well as in the higher, grassy areas in parts of Sauk, Dane, Jefferson, Walworth, and Waukesha counties.",,PDS,200605,11,1200
